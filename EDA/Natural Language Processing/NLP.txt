# Natural Language Processing
It is a field of AI that focuses on interaction between machine and human language.
It enables machine to read, understand, interpret and generate human language

Task in NLP:
=> Text Classification
=> Sentiment  Analysis
=> Language Translation
=> Speech Recognition
=> Chat Bots

Corpus: A large set of text data used for training the Machine.

Tokenization:  Converts the corpus into sentences.   [It is a process of breaking text into smaller parts called token{It can be words, characters and subwords}]
     Word tokenization:


Stemming: It is a process of removing suffixes from the word to reduce it to its base or root form
it doesn't always give a real word just a rough root
Ex: playing,played,plays    ----------> play
    writing,writes,writer   ----------> write

RegexStemmer: It works by applying the regular expression pattern to each word to remove suffixes or specific endings and optionally enforces a minimum stem length 

Parameters of RegexSemmer:
regexp  -->  STR()   the regular expression pattern to remove matching suffixes from the words>>> this should be a pattern that macthes the suffix you want to remove
MIN  --> INT         the minimum length a stemmed word must have if stemming would make the word shortened than(min) the word is return uncahnged

Wordnet Lemmatizer: it is a tool in NLP that reduce a word to its base or dictionary form known as lemma
ad - adverb
v - verb
n - noun
Lemmatization and stemming does not work in Upper Case
